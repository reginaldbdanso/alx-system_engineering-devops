#Command Line for the win

Steps to push files to sandbox via SFTP
1. I opened a terminal on my local machine.
2. I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. Used the SFTP hostname, username, and password provided in the sandbox environment.
3. Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I wanted to upload the screenshots, i.e. /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
4. I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox environment.
5. I then confirmed that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory, and the files had appeared.
6. I then pushed the screenshots to GitHub.
