# 0x0E-web_stack_debugging_1

## Description
This project is part of Foundations - System engineering & DevOps ― Web stack debugging curriculum:
- Debugging is pretty much the same concept as testing and Quality Assurance. It’s not feasible to write a code without bugs, and sometimes, even if your code seems to work for you, it can actually not work in some circumstances.
